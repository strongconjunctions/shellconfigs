These are my bash and zsh dotfiles with custom aliases and configs

Note that you have to link these config files to their respective .bashrc and .zshrc files located in your ~/ directory by placing one of these two lines in these two files respectively:
	source '~/bin/dotfiles/bash/.bashrc'    <-- put this line in ~/.bashrc
	source '~/bin/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc'	<-- put this line in ~/.zshrc
